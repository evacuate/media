## Introduction

`evacuate` is a service to support evacuation in the event of a disaster. Currently, it only provides information on earthquakes, but in the future, it will also provide information on evacuation centers and other useful information during disasters.

## Name

The name `evacuate` is derived from the word "evacuation," which means "to leave a place of danger to a safer place." The name was chosen to reflect the service's mission of providing information to help people evacuate safely.

Please make sure to use lower case letters for names
